- 👋 Hi, I’m @oublalkhalid
- 👀 I’m interested in the Satisfiability of Machine and Deep Learning (Cyber, Explainable AI, Causality..) 
- 🥇 MS.E in Computer Science (summa cum laude) from Ecole Polytechnique - Institut Polytechnique of Paris, France. Currently, I follow a Ph.D. program at the same institute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Normalizing flow, Generative Models for Times series | Explainability 
- 📚 [What I have read ?](https://github.com/oublalkhalid/What-I-have-read)
