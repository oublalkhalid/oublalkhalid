# Hello, welcome to my github repository !

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in the Satisfiability of Machine and Deep Learning (Explainable AI, Causality..), I am passionated for mathematics and its applications.
- ü•á MS.E in Computer Science (summa cum laude) from Ecole Polytechnique - Institut Polytechnique of Paris, France. Currently, I follow a Ph.D. program at the same institute.
- üíûÔ∏è Open to collaborate on Explainability for Generative Models 
- üìö [What I have read ?](https://github.com/oublalkhalid/What-I-have-read)
