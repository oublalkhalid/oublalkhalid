- 👋 Hi, I’m @oublalkhalid
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine and Deep Learning and their Satisfiability (Cyber, Explainable AI, Causality..) 
- 🥇 MS.E in Computer Science (summa cum laude) from Ecole Polytechnique - Institut Polytechnique of Paris, France. Currently I follow a Ph.D. program at the same institute.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Normalizing flow as a simple screening method to enhance VAEs and GANs resolution
