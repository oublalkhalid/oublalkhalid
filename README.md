- 👋 Hi, I’m @oublalkhalid
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine and Deep Learning and their Satisfiability (Cyber, Explainable AI, Causality..) 
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a M.S E. in Computer Science at Ecole Polytechnique, Paris France
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Normalizing Flow as a simple methods of GANs
